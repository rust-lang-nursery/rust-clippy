# Installation and Usage

Below are instructions on how to use Clippy as a subcommand, compiled from source
or in Travis CI.

### As a cargo subcommand (`cargo clippy`)

One way to use Clippy is by installing Clippy through rustup as a cargo
subcommand.

#### Step 1: Install rustup

You can install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) on supported platforms. This will help
us install Clippy and its dependencies.

If you already have rustup installed, update to ensure you have the latest
rustup and compiler:

```terminal
rustup update
```

#### Step 2: Install Clippy

Once you have rustup and the latest stable release (at least Rust 1.29) installed, run the following command:

```terminal
rustup component add clippy
```
If it says that it can't find the `clippy` component, please run `rustup self update`.

#### Step 3: Run Clippy

Now you can run Clippy by invoking the following command:

```terminal
cargo clippy
```

#### Automatically applying Clippy suggestions

Clippy can automatically apply some lint suggestions.
Note that this is still experimental and only supported on the nightly channel:

```terminal
cargo clippy --fix -Z unstable-options
```

#### Workspaces

All the usual workspace options should work with Clippy. For example the following command
will run Clippy on the `example` crate:

```terminal
cargo clippy -p example
```

As with `cargo check`, this includes dependencies that are members of the workspace, like path dependencies.
If you want to run Clippy **only** on the given crate, use the `--no-deps` option like this:

```terminal
cargo clippy -p example -- --no-deps 
```

### As a rustc replacement (`clippy-driver`)

Clippy can also be used in projects that do not use cargo. To do so, you will need to replace
your `rustc` compilation commands with `clippy-driver`. For example, if your project runs:

```terminal
rustc --edition 2018 -Cpanic=abort foo.rs
```

Then, to enable Clippy, you will need to call:

```terminal
clippy-driver --edition 2018 -Cpanic=abort foo.rs
```

Note that `rustc` will still run, i.e. it will still emit the output files it normally does.

### Travis CI

You can add Clippy to Travis CI in the same way you use it locally:

```yml
language: rust
rust:
  - stable
  - beta
before_script:
  - rustup component add clippy
script:
  - cargo clippy
  # if you want the build job to fail when encountering warnings, use
  - cargo clippy -- -D warnings
  # in order to also check tests and non-default crate features, use
  - cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
  - cargo test
  # etc.
```

Note that adding `-D warnings` will cause your build to fail if **any** warnings are found in your code.
That includes warnings found by rustc (e.g. `dead_code`, etc.). If you want to avoid this and only cause
an error for Clippy warnings, use `#![deny(clippy::all)]` in your code or `-D clippy::all` on the command
line. (You can swap `clippy::all` with the specific lint category you are targeting.)
